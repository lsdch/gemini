    {\Large 
    Asexual reproduction circumvents the many costs associated with sex, such as 
    finding and attracting mates. However, the most prominent reproduction mode 
    among multicellular organisms is sex. 
    %Within finite populations,
      \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{sexual recombination 
        increases the probability of fixing beneficial mutations} through Hill-Robertson 
        effect.
        \item \textbf{stochastic loss of conserved alleles}, a process known as Muller's Ratchet, occurs more frequently
        in lineages that don't undergo sex
      \end{itemize}
     %Furthermore, .\hfill

    $\Rightarrow$ \emph{Both processes lead to an increased rate of deleterious mutation accumulation 
    in asexual lineages.}

  \begin{block}{Hybrid origin of apomictic lineages}
    To determine whether apomictic haplotypes were derived solely from \textit{B. spatifolia} (non-hybrid origin) 
    or from hybridization with another \textit{Boechera} species, 
    22k trees generated from 5-sequence haplotype alignments were classified into six possible topologies.

      \begin{minipage}[c]{0.67\textwidth}

      \end{minipage}\hfill
      \begin{minipage}[c]{0.3\textwidth}
      \caption{\textbf{Classification of haplotype trees to infer the impact of hybridization.} 
      Those trees that present a hybrid evolutionary history are plotted on the left (\textbf{A-B}), 
      while all other threes are on the right (\textbf{C-F}).
      All trees are rooted against \textit{A. lyrata} as external group.
      }
      \end{minipage}
    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Topologies where one apomictic haplotype was
      basal while the other was nested within the sexual haplotypes indicated a
      hybrid origin. 
      \item Topologies producing apomictic haplotypes diverging from basal sexual 
      sequences are in favor of a true breeding origin.
    \end{itemize} 
    \textbf{The bulk (59.0\%) of the trees had a topology indicative of a hybrid origin. }

    % increased apomictic heterozygosity and
%the observation that 5/6 unambiguous trees were of hybrid origin, provide strong evidence that
%B. spatifolia apomicts were originally derived from hybridization.

      \caption{\textbf{Signatures of relaxed purifying selection in apomicts.}
      $\frac{d_N}{d_S}$ ratios were calculated for each population (\textbf{A}) and each SNPs 
      binned by their derived allele frequency among the 7 southern apomictic genotypes (\textbf{B}).
      For example n = 1 indicates a site where a single apomictic genotype has a derived allele, while n = 7
      represents sites where all apomicts share a derived allele.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Deleterious mutations are fixed at an accelerated rate in asexual 
      populations due to the absence of recombination.}
      \item \textbf{Efficiency of purifying selection is decreased in apomictic lineages}
      \item \textbf{Apomicts accumulate mutations in otherwise conserved sites, 
      consistently with the predictions of Hill-Robertson interference and Mullerâ€™s
      Ratchet.}
    \end{itemize}
    
%      Combined, our data demonstrated two levels of genome sequence diver-
% gence between Boechera mating systems. As expected, divergence was driven primarily by
% hybridization, as this is the mechanism through which apomixis spreads. However, contempo-
% rary mutation accumulation also impacted the molecular evolution of apomicts. In particular,
% these results demonstrated that apomicts were accumulating mutations in otherwise conserved
% sites, a pattern consistent with the predictions of
