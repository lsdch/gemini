    abstract = {Author Summary Most plants and animals reproduce through sex, a form of reproduction associated with many costs (e.g. finding and attracting mates). Asexual reproduction can circumvent these costs; however, it has only evolved in a handful of plant and animal species. Here, we address this evolutionary conundrum, and ask: why does sexual reproduction dominate among multicellular organisms? We find that asexual individuals harbor many more DNA mutations than sexual individuals. Importantly, asexual genotypes are more likely to retain mutations in highly-conserved sites (shared across species) that cause protein changes. Such mutations may be detrimental to asexually reproducing populations, and may increase the likelihood of extinction among lineages that do not undergo sex.},
